# IMDB Review Scrapper

A dataset scrapper implemented using beautifulsoup and selenium.

The MovieLens 1M Dataset has about 1 Million reviews of nearly 4000 movies from about 6000 users. However, it does not have information on the **cast and crew** of the movie and the **reviews** for those ratings.

This project aims to recreate the same dataset for the same movies with these missing data
